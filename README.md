Exploring Etsy APIs

### Goals
+ Pull down as much info on listings as possible to understand the data model
+ Maybe start a sample shop and compare the metadata from a buyer's perspective vs. a seller's perspective

[Binder URL](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/patrick-still/etsy/HEAD)
+ Binder seems to be less ephemeral than last time I worked with it
